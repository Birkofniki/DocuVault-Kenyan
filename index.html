        <!--2. If referencing to an image in the other page, do this,put the image's element in the place where you write the other page's name i.e[ <a href="about.html"> <img src="mydocsbank logo.png" alt="Mydocsbank Project Logo"> </a>],,,this image will be clickable-->

            <!--also used the &lt; and &gt to mean less than, or greater than symbols..since these are special characters in html and can't be used dierctly-->

        Problem: <em><strong>In today's world, we still rely on hard copies of important documents like IDs, passports, certificates, etc. This leads to numerous&nbsp; problems:</strong></em> <!--just decided to use the "strong element instead of "b" element, as b is considered outdated, and also html is not used for styling"-->

    <ul>
        <li>Carrying around physical documents is inconvenient and they can easily be lost, damaged or stolen.</li>
        <li>Verifying identity or qualifications with paper documents is tedious.</li>
        <li>Sharing or transmitting documents digitally is difficult.</li>
        <li>Managing and organizing a large number of physical documents is a challenge. </li>
